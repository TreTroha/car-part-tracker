# Car Part Tracker
This is a car part tracked CRUD app built as a passion project to help me keep track of the project car I have.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express

I started with a form and built that out to send data to a Mongo database, then once I got the parameters worked out structured my EJS so I did not have a single line of hard-coded HTML in the entire program. From there I built out the Express server side code using the built in modules + dotenv & cors, 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

First iteration is locked in as a single user build. Will go back through and add log-in capability and authentication then push to Heroku so it can be distributed to my car friends.

## Lessons Learned:

This app was built using Express and acts as the first full CRUD app I have built from a passion. Coming from vanilla Node the toolbelt that express contains already preloaded was so much fun to use. (ie; get, post, delete, etc..). Combining that with some simple EJS enabled me to actually create a responsive page and reduced the number of hard coded HTML to literally 0 in this application.
